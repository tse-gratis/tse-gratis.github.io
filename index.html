<h1>Animation</h1>
<div class="middle">
<div><span class="dropCap">W</span>e had no idea where to go, but were surprized by a few simple miracles
<br/><br/>
So it took a month of working into the night (to the extent of becoming ill), but I learned to do animation, and put together this short film of how it all happened
<br/><br/>
<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7n67LpQxzY4?autoplay=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<br/><br/>
The first woman was a prostitute who almost died, but met Jesus in a dream;<s> </s>which led to me and my wife meeting (who drew the people)
<br/><br/>
<sub>2013</sub>
</div></div>
<h1>Lira’s Rain</h1>
<div class="middle">
<div><span class="dropCap">W</span>e could see people running around screaming.<s> </s>A hut, one of their homes, had caught fire.<s> </s>Possibly from the scorching noon day sun.<s> </s>We were sitting under the shade, sipping cool drinks.<s> </s>Moments earlier we had driven past, and they had cheered and danced;<s> </s>thinking we were finally delivering aid.<s> </s>But we had not come for them.<s> </s>We had come to visit a friend in the next field
<br/><br/>
IMG_BG(buildingNUganda.jpg, 345,200,)Now we could see them screaming with no water to put the fire out, but still running in to pull their belongings out
<br/><br/>
There was nothing I could do;<s> </s>so I closed my eyes and prayed:<s> </s>"God, please make it rain."<s> </s>It was midday, just below the Sahara, in the hot season;<s> </s>there wasn't a cloud in the sky
<br/><br/>
A drop of water landed on my hand.<s> </s>I opened my eyes.<s> </s>What followed was a torrential downpour, that not only put out the fire, but also sent us running for cover
<br/><br/>
10 minutes later the rain ended;<s> </s>there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the Ugandans I was with said they'd never seen weather like it before
<br/><br/>
That happened to me in Lira Uganda, 2004.<s> </s>A more recent event of another refugee's home going up in a fireball happened in 2016...<s> </s>But let me tell you about that another time
<br/><br/>
<sub>2004</sub>
</div></div>
<h1>Sub sahara</h1>
<div class="middle">
<div><span class="dropCap">A</span> guy here felt called to pray in various towns.<s> </s>So he’s left to do it, even though he doesn’t have the money and doesn’t think it will be safe.<s> </s>He had just come from Nigeria by bus.<s> </s>He paid for the trip, and went to get a bite.<s> </s>But then the bus filled up, so they unloaded his bags, and left without him.<s> </s>He lost his money.<s> </s>But when he eventually got here, he found the same people just sitting around: an armed gang had waylaid them and cleaned them out.<s> </s>So he thanks God for his protection
<br/><br/>
IMG_BG(womenAid.jpg, 330, 248,,imgRight)But things don’t happen like I expect here.<s> </s>I was throwing up bile last week, a novel experience.<s> </s>And a guy who lives with me asked his supporters in Zambia to pray about it.<s> </s>He said it was a real challenge and blessing to them that a foreigner was here and throwing up.<s> </s>I’m not sure that’s quite how I intended to bless people...
<br/><br/>
But this guy used to be a successful drug dealer, and was never caught.<s> </s>So I wont give any pictures of him.<s> </s>He prays about everything he does, and is working with a partner on projects that sometimes seem impossible.<s> </s>Though the partner has decided not to return, because of the war
<br/><br/>
We went around to a friend from Nigeria, and said:<s> </s>“We really need your prayers, because our landlord is forcing us out of the house and we have nowhere to go.”<s> </s>We didn’t have a lot of faith, since houses are hard to get here.<s> </s>Our friend responded “Wow &mdash; this is an answer to prayer.”<s> </s>We had been digging our house out after the rain, and trying to stop it falling down.<s> </s>On seeing this our friend had been close to forcing us out himself, and said “If God can answer my prayers to kick you out;<s> </s>he can easily find you another house.”
<br/><br/>
It’s still a big issue though, as we haven’t yet found one
<br/><br/>
I canceled a trip to the north, incase the rebels came.<s> </s>But I went to the east a few weeks ago.<s> </s>And it pushed me to think:<s> </s>“Somebody would have to be crazy to come here.”<s> </s>I’ve found life harder than I expected, and even simple things difficult to do.<s> </s>Like cooking tea in the dark.<s> </s>These things teach me my strength has to come from God.<s> </s>Though I’ve spent some of the last few weeks resting, mostly due to sickness and heat stress
<br/><br/>
The rebels were more active in the east a few days ago.<s> </s>And it looked like they might come here.<s> </s>Some people I trust from Switzerland included me in their evacuation plans, and they act from past experience.<s> </s>But there’s been no new fighting for the last 2 days.<s> </s>So we no longer expect them.<s> </s>But if they do come, I’ll email you again when I reach the home
<br/><br/>

<h1>Joy in Prison</h1>
<div class="middle">
<div><span class="dropCap">M</span>y friend’s nephew was trying to break down the front door with a knife, screaming<s> </s>“I’m going to kill you.”<s> </s>His nephew had joined a terrorist group, and this was the answer to my friend becoming Christian
<br/><br/>
The neighbours heard the sound, and called the police.<s> </s>When they came, his nephew fled...
</div><div><span class="dropCap">A</span>nd our pastor is still in prison.<s> </s>He is charged with attempting to overthrow the government.<s> </s>Still no evidence to support any charge has been given
<br/><br/>
It reminded me of my friend Suleyman.<s> </s>His family had handed him to the police for changing his faith, and the police imprisoned him.<s> </s>There was little hope for his release.<s> </s>The prison janitor was a Christian however.<s> </s>When they discovered each other;<s> </s>the janitor would smuggle in scraps of the Bible, to pass to him.<s> </s>Maybe a little like how drugs get into our prisons?
<br/><br/>
I don’t know how it happened:<s> </s>But one day Suleyman simply walked past the prison guards, out through the gate;<s> </s>got to the border, and crossed over.<s> </s>Without anyone stopping him
<br/><br/>
Last month our pastor’s children got to visit him.<s> </s>This month he has been moved to a maximum security facility.<s> </s>Next month he will have been in prison for one year.<s> </s>It is hard and disheartening for him. He needs our prayers
<br/><br/>
He needs to know hope in the midst of his trouble, like Paul and Silas in Acts 16
<br/><br/>
“The joy of the LORD is our strength.”<s> </s>This is our answer when the world is too much
</div><div><span class="dropCap">O</span>ur pastor’s church have been having barbeque baptisms by the sea, birthday parties full of laughter;<s> </s>they’re begining new churches, and having meetings of praise and worship:<s> </s>even of exuberant celebration
<br/><br/>
It is in this praise that we do what God asks of us:<s> </s>to agree that he is good and awesome
<br/><br/>
This is our reality.<s> </s>This is a joy that we and the church are learning to stand in
</div><div><span class="dropCap">S</span>ometimes yes, this world is too much for us.<s> </s>But is it ever too much for God?<s> </s>What he says rather than what we see is a perspective of hope.<s> </s>What is life like from that perspective?
<br/><br/>
Yesterday I enjoyed where God says that in the future the lions will eat grass, wolves will live with lambs, and toddlers will play beside cobras;<s> </s>with no harm or destruction (Isaiah 11)
<br/><br/>
That’s too cute
<br/><br/>
... Now my friend asks me to bring him a large TV, to help him invite strangers into that same home his nephew came to;<s> </s>to sit with his family, and tell them of his hope
