<p>›</p>luke2.8-10
<p>›</p>8And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.  9An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.  10But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid.  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people

<p>›</p>[[Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you;  he is the Messiah, the Lord.  12This will be a sign to you:  You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
	<p>›</p>13Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
	<p>›</p>14“Glory to God in the highest heaven,
	<p>›</p>and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”]]

<p>›</p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”

<p>›</p>16So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.  17When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them

<p>›</p>[[But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.  20The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.]]
