<p>›</p>phil3.7-11 But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.  8What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.  I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in a Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.  10I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead

<p>›</p>rom8.35Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?  36As it is written:  “For your sake we face death all day long;  we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”
  <p>›</p>37No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  38For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, k neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord

<p>›</p>luke15.1-7 1Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus.  2But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

<p>›</p>3Then Jesus told them this parable:  4“What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?  5And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders, 6comes home, and calls together his friends and neighbors to tell them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!’ 7I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous ones who do not need to repent

<p>›</p>One episode tells the remarkable story of Malta’s miraculous protection.  Under relentless air raids from the Axis powers, the island of Malta was close to collapse.  Supplies were running out.  The people were exhausted.  In desperation, believers across the world began to pray.  Meanwhile, at the Welsh Bible College led by Rees Howells, students spent months in intercessory prayer for Malta

<p>›</p>What followed was a turning point.  Against all odds, supply ships made it through enemy waters.  The bombs missed their targets

	<p>›</p>...  I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory

<p>›</p>from the middle of prison and suffering, Paul writes this overflowing blessing in the hope of Christ, so we may also be blessed, no matter what we face
