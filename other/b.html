<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span> overview</h1>
<p>›</p>Communion
<p>›</p>who are we
	<p>›</p>something explosive at the heart of the gospel
<p>›</p>breaking of bread
	<p>›</p>like splitting the atom



<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span> give thanks</h1>
	<p>›</p>maybe thanks giving for what Jesus has done, then prayer
<p>›</p>[[heb12.2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.  For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God
<p>›</p>rom8..34 who then is the one who condemns?  No one.  Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us]]

<p>›</p>col2.13b-15 God made you alive with Christ.  He forgave us all our sins, 14having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us;  he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.  15And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross

<p>›</p>let us thank God together
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> pray together</tt>
	<p>›</p>rom8.2 For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death
	<p>›</p>rom8.1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
	<p>›</p>rom8.3 For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son

	 <p>›</p>tola’ath (or tola).  This refers to the crimson worm (Kermes)
	<p>›</p>rimma is a maggot, associated with decay
		<p>›</p>job25
			<p>›</p>v4 how then can a mortal be righteous before God?

	<p>›</p>The Kingdom of God is like:
	<p>›</p>v16b great banquet and invited many guests

<h2 id="h7"><span>==</span> actual communion</h2>
<p>›</p>who are we here?
<p>›</p>there is something explosive at the heart of the bible
	<p>›</p>the sinner set free
	<p>›</p>eternity for the dying
	<p>›</p>hope for the least and the last dregs of society
	<p>›</p>that God would give himself for us

	<p>›</p>starting from a small group of nobodies, and exploding out, in humility and selflessness, that changes the world

<p>›</p>the atom bomb

<p>›</p>who are we?
<p>›</p>we are those who come together to encounter risen Christ, and His body, split upon the cross

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> hand it out, then read</tt>

<p>›</p>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you:  The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread
	<p>›</p>and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you;  do this in remembrance of Me.”

<p>›</p>In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood;  do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
<p>›</p>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes



<h1 id="h8"><span>=</span> final blessing?</h1>
<p>›</p>the IAM bless you and keep you;
<p>›</p>the IAM beam over you,
    <p>›</p>and be gracious to you;
<p>›</p>the IAM look with favor on you,
    <p>›</p>and give you peace
