<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span>  intro</h1>
<p>›</p>zech1.3
<p>›</p>Therefore tell the people:  This is what the LORD Almighty says:  ‘Return to me,’ declares the LORD Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the LORD Almighty

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span>  Father we want to turn to you;  we honour you that all we have is from your hands</tt>
	<p>›</p>every morsel of food is due to your name, and to your glory
	<p>›</p>we praise you

<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span>  humbled himself</h1>
<p>›</p>phil2.6
<p>›</p>Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,a 7but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness.  8And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death — even death on a cross

<p>›</p>The King of Kings, the Lord of Glory, didn’t lord it over us, but humbled himself, coming in the form of a baby, and becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross

<p>›</p>even we’re sinners, even we dont deserve it;  He still empties Himself and takes the form of a servant

<p>›</p>LORD, thankyou for this love
	<p>›</p>let it enter us, let it be in us;  let us not have hard hearts, but receive and accept that you love us in this way

<tt class="action"><span>%</span>  that we may accept and come to fully know this love, just as we are fully known</tt>

<h1 id="h2"><span>=</span>  confess</h1>
<p>›</p>4 prerequisites for baptism of the Holy Spirit:
<p>›</p>›1.  confess all sins
<p>›</p>›2.  remove anything doubtful

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span>  i confess;  and confess my doubtful things</tt>

<p>›</p>isaiah40.29-31
<p>›</p>He gives power to the faint and increases the strength of the weak.  / Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall.  / But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength;  they will mount up with wings like eagles;  they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint

<tt class="action"><span>%</span>  Bethan to finish with another hymn</tt>
