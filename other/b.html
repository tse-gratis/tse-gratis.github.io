<p>›</p>beloved, not based on what they do

<p>›</p>Uganda
<p>›</p>Encounter
<p>›</p>Family planting with refugees
	<p>›</p>So fun, and so easily doable
<p>›</p>Yedid, an example of transformation

<p>›</p>Zacs



<p>›</p>1.  “Before you came to Parklands, what was your journey with God like?”

<p>›</p>(This invites a testimony without limiting it to geography or a single event.)

<p>›</p>2.  “How did that experience shape the way you now live as a follower of Jesus?”

<p>›</p>(Draws out the theme of living from God’s love.)


<p>›</p>3.  “Could you share a practical example of what that looks like in your everyday life?”

<p>›</p>(Opens the door for the Zac’s Place story naturally.)

<p>›</p>4.  “As a church family, what’s one simple step we could all take in response to what you’ve shared?”

<p>›</p>(Gives a clear runway to invite the congregation to act—e.g., asking a neighbour a question.)

<p>›</p>–
<p>›</p>then i ask the congregation “so you are that joy;  and the person beside you is that joy, so introduce yourself to someone beside you, and ask them what is their next step in living from Christ’s love”

<p>›</p>i.e.  in doing that, they step into practically living out that last testimony, of someone being overcome by the love of God, and opening their heart



<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span> Before you came to Parklands, what was your journey with God like?</h1>
<p>›</p>i went to Uganda, and to the North of Uganda, which was a warzone
	<p>›</p>thousands of people per camp, sleeping out on flat sandy earth, with one toilet per 100 people
	<p>›</p>using bendy cane and cardboard to protect themselves from the sun
	<p>›</p>the UN would stockpile food there, but not for those people, but to send further north
	<p>›</p>because they’re a different tribe to the army, they felt the army rarely supported them
		<p>›</p>felt like the world had forgotten them

	<p>›</p>sent a radio message to those attacking them, we love you, we forgive you, please come back home

	<p>›</p>their faith, building one of the largest churches ive seen
	<p>›</p>when you go back, tell them we need their help, no no, dont tell them that, tell them we love them

	<p>›</p>Lira’s rain


<h1 id="h2"><span>=</span> How did that experience shape the way you now live as a follower of Jesus?</h1>
<p>›</p>from there, and then from Parklands, ive gone on to see the the faithfulness of God in Yemen and Syria, and seen His goodness in those places

<p>›</p>i guess there are too many miracles and stories to tell or to remember, but one that shaped me:

<p>›</p>i had been struggling a lot with my own personal problems, then one year i said God this is too much for me, i dont want to keep carring this, let me give them to you?  that summer i had an encounter with God that was too awesome to describe.  it answered those problems id had, and it gave me a new understanding of God as Father

<p>›</p>where we were living in the Middle East, people started calling me Father, and families started;  there were like 10 of them or something, with the Syrian refugees, we were sitting on the floor with the covered women and the chickens, as the women would read and discuss the bible, and the children would lead the worship

<p>›</p>God was doing something beautiful and simple there, and i want to emphasize how easy it is for anybody to do

<p>›</p>when Jesus crosses Galilee to the Gerasenes
	<p>›</p>he meets, an utter nutcase, Jesus heals him, and sends him out to share the good news

<p>›</p>Tolun

<h1 id="h3"><span>=</span> thanks and prayer</h1>
<p>›</p>its thanks to God answering your prayers, and the prayers of people like Brian Davis that we can share these things

<p>›</p>[[to have faith in the Almighty to answer prayer:  that’s kind of obvious, He’s the Almighty;  but for the Almighty to have faith in us?  why?  yet He trust us with His kingdom;  that’s faith (that he trust me, he trusts you).  but not just His kingdom, He entrusts His heart to you]]



<h1 id="h4"><span>=</span> Could you share a practical example of what that looks like in your everyday life?</h1>
<p>›</p>Three Cliffs Margaret, promises of God
<p>›</p>Zacs



<h1 id="h5"><span>=</span> As a church family, what’s one simple step we could all take in response to what you’ve shared?</h1>
<p>›</p>321 course

<tt class="action"><span>%%</span> (for the joy set before Him He endured the cross) tell person beside you:  you are the joy for which He gave His life</tt>

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> then pray together (congregation following, then Mike)</tt>

<p>›</p>thankyou that you come to me not in my strength and prowess, but in my brokenness and weakness.  thankyou that you meet us in those places

<p>›</p>Father, i invite you in, come have your way among us, come have your way in me

<p>›</p>as You have given Yourself to me, let me respond, I AM YOURS

<p>›</p>4th Janurary 15mins Q.A.  on sofa with Dan Marks, before end of month – 4 or 5 questions
	<p>›</p>3 people sharing testimonies

<p>›</p>–
	<p>›</p>Jesus what would you like to say, let me give this time to you
<p>›</p>–
	<p>›</p>you are very coy, but you want to give them a practical invite to DMM and living from the love of God


<p>›</p>hi guys, here’s a quick overview of potential questions for jan4th:

<p>›</p>Q:  tell me what happened to you, before you joined Parklands?
<p>›</p>A:  testimony from Uganda

<p>›</p>Q:  what did you do as a result of that?
<p>›</p>A:  living from the love of God

<p>›</p>Q:  could you give us an example of living like that?
<p>›</p>A:  practical example testimony from Zac’s Place

<p>›</p>Q:  what is our next step from here?
<p>›</p>A:  invite congregation to make such a step;  i.e.  simply ask their neighbour a question



<p>›</p>and here’s a more detailed breakdown of answers to those questions.  can be changed or can add more detail, etc.  rather than pack things in, the plan is simple and experiential – just two direct testimonies and then an invite for people to consider how to live from those testimonies

<p>›</p>anyhows, here it is:

<p>›</p>Q:  hi Samuel, i actually know you at Parklands from years ago, you actually worked at Parklands for a year (i.e.  introduce me however you like, so im not a random stranger 👍), tell me what happened to you, before you joined Parklands?
<p>›</p>A:
<p>›</p>Uganda.  i.e.  testimony of the awesomeness of God

<p>›</p>i could then ask the church “what would you do as a result of that?”
	<p>›</p>probably they wont respond

<p>›</p>but then i ask you “what would you do as a result of that?”
	<p>›</p>and you can respond however you like



<p>›</p>Q:  (then you ask me) what did you do as a result of that?
<p>›</p>A:
<p>›</p>i might reply:
	<p>›</p>other than join Parklands?  dare to trust God at His word, and step out

<p>›</p><s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</s>
	<p>›</p>i need to explain this next bit more i.e.  simply be explicit “that’s what i did”
	<p>›</p>and where’s the application with the following paragraph on theology?
	<p>›</p>so maybe add
		<p>›</p>“then we went onto inviting people to live from that place”
		<p>›</p>probably mention refugee housechurch – just to give them some key


<p>›</p>i mean, many testimonies from living in Syria, Yemen, Sahara, and so forth
	<p>›</p>seeing, even in those places, even in war, that God is faithful

<p>›</p>but its not about what we do;  its about what he did !!
	<p>›</p>He came not for the righteous, but for the sinners
	<p>›</p>rom5.8 but God proves His love for us in this:  while we were still sinners, Christ died for us
	<p>›</p>He loves us here, in our broken places
	<p>›</p>the wildness of His love, is that He uses even me;  even you

<p>›</p>quote from Jireh by Elevation Worship:
<p>›</p>“wasnt holding you up, so there’s nothing i can do to let you down
 <p>›</p>it doesnt take a trophy to make you proud
 <p>›</p>ive never been more loved than i am right now”

<p>›</p>(the worship team might suggest a different song to quote, that they plan to play at the end, or i can do what Dan Marks suggests here)



<p>›</p>Q:  (so living in response to the love of God...  Dan could summarize however he likes) could you give us an example of living like that?
<p>›</p>A:
<p>›</p>Zacs, we love you

<p>›</p>(thats the title of a testimony i tell, essentially someone gives their heart to Christ and stops killing people)



<p>›</p>Q:  what is our next step from here?
<p>›</p>A:
<p>›</p>i can give a cross-over, the time dependent long version, i might skip, would be they are the joy for which he died;  and i explain that via describing myself experiencing church leading, and seeing people as that joy

<p>›</p>then i ask the congregation “so you are that joy;  and the person beside you is that joy, so introduce yourself to someone beside you, and ask them what is their next step in living from Christ’s love”

<p>›</p>i.e.  in doing that, they step into practically living out that last testimony, of someone being overcome by the love of God, and opening their heart



<p>›</p><s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</s>
<p>›</p>uganda
	<p>›</p>rebels, felt like the world had forgotten them
	<p>›</p>we love you
	<p>›</p>situation, stockpiling food further north
	<p>›</p>forgive those attacking them
	<p>›</p>lira’s rain
	
<p>›</p>love of God
<p>›</p>see people live out the fullness of what it means to follow Jesus

<p>›</p>Zacs, (what is Zacs, Dan Marks to introduce?)
<p>›</p>God loves you, we love you, but how can i say i love you if i dont know you?



<p>›</p>what do you want to say to Parklands?
<p>›</p>what do you want to do going forwards?
	<p>›</p>build people up
	<p>›</p>they can disciple
	<p>›</p>they can do this !!!


<p>›</p>ask your neighbour how their walk with Jesus has been
	<p>›</p>not asking what they did
	<p>›</p>it’s about what he did, on the cross
	<p>›</p>what’s it been like, listening to Him
