<tt class="action"><span>%</span> eph1v7-12</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> how should we party as a result of these things?</tt>

<p>›</p>we who are for the praise of His glory;  today we’re going to step together in learning to party and celebrate like that

<p>›</p>we have games, food, and worship maybe in Korean and Brazilian;  how should we begin?
