<p>›</p>1john3 See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!  And that is what we are!  The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him

<p>›</p>beloved, do we know us?  do we know the great love our Father has lavished on us?

<p>›</p>John transformed from a son of thunder, because he looked in Jesus eyes to find out who he was.  he became ‘the disciple who Jesus loved.’  in the gospel of John, in the place of giving his own name, he calls himself ‘the disciple who Jesus loves.’  he does that 5x

<p>›</p>you are the disciple Jesus loves

<p>›</p>John was there close to Jesus at the crucifixion, as Jesus spoke to him and Mary;

<p>›</p>its from this;  from his eyes being on Jesus, and finding he is the beloved;  John’s eyes are on him as he encounters the resurrected Christ in the book of Revelation

<p>›</p>in revelation John writes “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day,” and from there John describes his encounter with the living God

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> balloon</tt>

<p>›</p>we as His beloved, would like that encounter

<p>›</p>john3.8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit

<p>›</p>matt11.28 Come to me, all you who labour and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest

<p>›</p>luke11.46 And he said, “Woe to you lawyers also!  For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers
  <p>›</p>don’t need to strive to be accepted.  He has already completed that work on the cross.  so we live from that, and rest in that

<p>›</p>john14.15-21 Whoever has my commands and keeps them ...  and I too will love them and show myself to them

<p>›</p>Why should I teach when the Spirit is teaching?  What need have these people to be told that they are sinners?  What they need is salvation.  Do they not know it?  It is not knowledge that they lack, but decision – action.  And why should I control the meetings?  The meetings control themselves, or rather the Spirit that is in them controls them
