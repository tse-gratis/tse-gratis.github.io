  <p>›</p>no priests, no bible, no church
  <p>›</p>and yet the fastest growing most passionate church

<p>›</p>rejoice in grief

<p>›</p>not a false seperated joy;  but even here, in this place;  to sing

<p>›</p>3 worship songs, with words

<p>›</p>breathes life into things that are dead, and calls into being those that are not



<p>›</p>sen beni kurtarabilirsin, hersey senin elinde dir.  benim gelecegimi, benim kimiligimi

<p>›</p>kimsin ben?

<p>›</p>Bede, veya obururleri esiz, cocuksuz, Hristiyan dini devam ettiler

<p>›</p>advent of joy
<p>›</p>phil4v4 Rejoice in the Lord always.  Again I will say, rejoice!



<p>›</p>is61v1The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners,a 2to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favorb and the day of our God’s vengeance, to comfort all who mourn, 3to console the mourners in Zion— to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair.  So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified

<p>›</p>v21 A woman has pain in childbirth because her time has come;  but when she brings forth her child, she forgets her anguish because of her joy that a child has been born into the world
<p>›</p>v22 So with you:  Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy
	<p>›</p>john16v22

<p>›</p>If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love.  11I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.  12This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  13Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends
	<p>›</p>john15v10-13 no greater love than this



<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span> 1Samuel21 before the king of Gath</h1>
<p>›</p>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.  11But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land?  Did they not sing about him in their dances, saying:

<p>›</p>‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?”

<p>›</p>12Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  13So he changed his behavior before them and feigned madness in their hands;  he scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard

<p>›</p>14Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you can see that the man is insane!  Why have you brought him to me?  15Am I in need of madmen, that you have brought this man to rave in my presence?  Must this man come into my house?”



<p>›</p>God, how can i do this;  life is not easy, life is not fair;  there are many sadnesses
<p>›</p>what do you say in that place;  what do you do?



<p>›</p>Jesus, what would you have me do?

<p>›</p>advent of JOY, of Christ’s introduction




<p>›</p>welcome
<p>›</p>BP introduce herself
<p>›</p>joy
<p>›</p>1john3v20 Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and He knows all things
	<p>›</p>we give our hearts and our thoughts to Him;  let us not look with worldly eyes

<p>›</p>carols

<p>›</p>silent night
<p>›</p>light of the world, stepped down into darkness

<p>›</p>oh come let us adore Him



<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span> intro</h1>
<p>›</p>im known for being traditional
	<p>›</p>suggested to celebrate Christmas with a pyjama party
		<p>›</p>some of the adults have decided not to come

<p>›</p>welcome week 3 of advent, which traditionally looks at the joy of Jesus coming into the world

<p>›</p>the traditional text to read is the angels introducing His coming:  luke2v8-14
<p>›</p>and we’re going to be extra traditional, because Oi is going to lead some carols at the end

<p>›</p>actually we’ll have two introductions of Jesus;  the introductions of the messengers, and then of Jesus introducing Himself is61v1-3
	<p>›</p>in His hometown, to His homies
	<p>›</p>someone read luke2v8-14 then we all turn to is61

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> luke2v8-14</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> isaiah61v1-3</tt>

<p>›</p>And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  9And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.  10And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  11For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.  12And this will be a sign for you:  you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 13And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
	<p>›</p>14“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!

<p>›</p>when Jesus is older He introduces himself in His hometown, to the people He grew up with

<p>›</p>is61v1The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, [[to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners,a 2to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favorb and the day of our God’s vengeance,]] to comfort all who mourn, 3to console the mourners in Zion — to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair.  So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what is prophesied in this verse?</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what exchanges mouring for joy, where are we in this, and how can we enter in?</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> this is also our role, as we follow in Christ’s footsteps, to do this...  how can we step into those footsteps</tt>

<p>›</p>actually spoken to the mourners of Zion (!!!), that this is who Jesus came for;  if you’re mourning today, then He spoke these words for you;  to give THEM a crown of beauty for ashes

<p>›</p>and what will happen to the mourners of Zion?
	<p>›</p>not only the crown of beauty for ashes
	<p>›</p>the oil of joy, a garment of praise
	<p>›</p>called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD
	<p>›</p>...  read on
<p>›</p>is61v4-7 They will rebuild the ancient ruins;  they will restore the places long devastated;  they will renew the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.  5Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.  6But you will be called the priests of the LORD;  they will speak of you as ministers of our God;  you will feed on the wealth of nations, and you will boast in their riches.  7Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion, and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their share;  and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs



<p>›</p>1peter4v12-13 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.  13But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed

<p>›</p>phil4v4 Rejoice in the Lord always.  Again I will say, rejoice!

<p>›</p>lay down my own words in my head, lay down my own feelings, and say LORD, your ways are better you are LORD:  so i give my thoughts and feelings and desires to you

<p>›</p>Jesus wept, when Lazarus was in the tomb;  knowing full well that He would raise Him from the dead moments later;  this joy is specifically coming for those who mourn

<h1 id="h2"><span>=</span> songs</h1>
<p>›</p>no matter we’re mourning, or we feel joyful

<p>›</p>let us proclaim He is greater than our hearts



<p>›</p>as we welcome Christ, welcome each other

<p>›</p>jer31v15This is what the Lord says:  “A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.” 16This is what the Lord says:  “Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord
