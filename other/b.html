<h1 id="h3"><span>=</span> welcome</h1>
<p>›</p>welcome, we love you
<p>›</p>the inn keepers closed their door to welcoming Christ’s coming on that Holy Night.  but the gathering in that stable, and maybe here, was filled with great joy and wonder
  <p>›</p>the King of Glory was entering our world in the most humble and gentle way possible

<p>›</p>Jesus tells a story of how that King will welcome us into His home

<p>›</p>34Then the King will say to the people on his right, ‘Come, you that are blessed by my Father!  Come and possess the kingdom which has been prepared for you ever since the creation of the world.  35 I was hungry and you fed me, thirsty and you gave me a drink;  I was a stranger and you received me in your homes, 36naked and you clothed me;  I was sick and you took care of me, in prison and you visited me.’ 37The righteous will then answer him, ‘When, Lord, did we ever see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?  38When did we ever see you a stranger and welcome you in our homes, or naked and clothe you?  39When did we ever see you sick or in prison, and visit you?’ 40The King will reply, ‘I tell you, whenever you did this for one of the least important of these followers of mine, you did it for me!’

<p>›</p>so even if you feel one of the least important, Christ sees Himself in you, and sees Himself in each of those around you
