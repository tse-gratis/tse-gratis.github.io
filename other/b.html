<p>›</p>Zech4.6So he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel:  Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts.  7What are you, O great mountain?  Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain.  Then he will bring forth the capstone accompanied by shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”
<p>›</p>8Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 9“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it.  Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.  10For who has despised the day of small things?  But these seven eyes of the LORD, which scan the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.”

<p>›</p>what footsteps of Evan Roberts would you like to follow in?
	<p>›</p>humility, that he spent his time in prayer
	<p>›</p>him as a young child, his commitment

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> it is not the hilltop moments, but the quiet dedication of the heart, that our Lord desires</tt>

<p>›</p>God, what would you like to do
<p>›</p>honor David more than ourselves

<p>›</p>God where do you want me to go with this ??



<p>›</p>[[Demir

	<p>›</p>began reading the bible, came into his right mind
	<p>›</p>going to visit refugees, baklava
	<p>›</p>his cross]]
<p>›</p>heb12.2 let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.  who for the joy set before him endured the cross


<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> what Jesus sees – and is this enough for you;  did we do church planting for any other reason?</tt>

<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span> welcome</h1>
<p>›</p>john10.11 the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
	<p>›</p>He lays down His life for us
	<p>›</p>what would that mean for me to lay down my life for you, what would that look like?
	<p>›</p>tell me your answers at the end

<p>›</p>romans5.10 for if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, _far more_, having reconciled, shall we be saved by his life
	<p>›</p>what would it look like to lay down our lives for each other, and even for our enemies?

<p>›</p>but it says, far more than that, is we have one who came to save us.  He did not come for the great and the powerful, for the succesful, but came to a stable, and valued even us, when we were His enemies, with laying down His life

<p>›</p>so how valuable to Him are you?  more than His life

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> someone to read rom8.31-34</tt>
<p>›</p>rom8.31 so what then shall we say in response to these things?  if God is for us, who can be against us?  32He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things?  33who will bring any charge against God’s elect?  It is God who justifies.  34who is there to condemn us?

	<p>›</p>someone act as the pharisee today
<tt class="question"><span>?</span> what was confusing / or what did you like</tt>
<tt class="question"><span>?</span> what did it tell us about God and our relationship with Him</tt>
<tt class="question"><span>?</span> what does this parable mean for our own lives;  what will we do with this</tt>
<tt class="question"><span>?</span> is there someone we can tell the story to</tt>

<h1 id="h7"><span>=</span> parable</h1>
<p>›</p>luke18
<p>›</p>9To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable:  10“Two men went up to the temple to pray.  One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  11The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,a ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.  12I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’

<p>›</p>13But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven.  Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’ 14I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified.  For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

<h1 id="h8"><span>=</span> response</h1>
<p>›</p>sinners—those who knew they could not save themselves
<p>›</p>pharisee prayer is all about himself
<p>›</p>tax collector is the one who asked and looked for mercy

<p>›</p>we are righteous not on our own merit
<p>›</p>mark2.17 Jesus told them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.  I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners”

<p>›</p>rom5.8 But God proves His love for us in this:  While we were still sinners, Christ died for us

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> read rom8.31-34 again</tt>
	 <p>›</p>if God is for us, who can be against us ...  then 37;  no, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us

<p>›</p>eph2.8 for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God

<p>›</p>on Christ the solid rock i stand, all other ground is sinking sand

<p>›</p>we are saved by grace halleuljah !!!

<h1 id="h13"><span>=</span> moriah friends</h1>
<p>›</p>Seiadd is how Moriah started
<p>›</p>questions they have
<p>›</p>stories of Jesus

<h2 id="h14"><span>==</span> how can we shine brightly for Jesus?</h2>
<p>›</p>Philippians 2:14-15 Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 15.  so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world

<h2 id="h15"><span>==</span> difference between happiness and joy?</h2>
<p>›</p>Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23.  gentleness, and self-control.  Against such things there is no law.  24.  Now those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires

<p>›</p>Nehemiah 8:9-12 Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priestly scribe, and the Levites who were imparting understanding to the people said to all of them, “This day is holy to the LORD your God.  Do not mourn or weep.”  For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the law.  10.  He said to them, “Go and eat delicacies and drink sweet drinks and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared.  For this day is holy to our Lord.  Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”  11.  Then the Levites quieted all the people saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy.  Do not grieve.”  12.  So all the people departed to eat and drink and to share their food with others and to enjoy tremendous joy, for they had gained insight in the matters that had been made known to them

<p>›</p>James 1:2 My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials
