<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span> the shortest verse</h1>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what’s the shortest verse?</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> john 11.35-37 Jesus wept</tt>
<p>›</p>Written when Jesus was at the tomb of Lazarus
	<p>›</p>Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”
	<p>›</p>But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”

<p>›</p>1.  okay to experience grief, and to weigh it
<p>›</p>2.  also we notice, that Jesus brings Lazarus back to life – from weeping and mourning, Jesus fully turns the world upside down – from death to life
<p>›</p>3.  that there is comfort in the middle of the mourning

<p>›</p>Nabeel Qareshi
	<p>›</p>came to faith from reading this verse:  no comfort within the quran
	<p>›</p>Muhammed (real name Qthm) doesnt know if he’s going to heaven – why follow someone who doesnt know where they’re going



<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span> comfort</h1>
<p>›</p>Ἰησοῦς Ἐδάκρυσεν

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> Revelation21.4  ‘He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,’ and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the former things have passed away”</tt>

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> Isaiah25.8  He will swallow up death forever.  The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth.  For the LORD has spoken</tt>

<p>›</p>wild that we have a God that comforts us

<tt class="question"><span>?</span> how does our God comfort us</tt>

<h2 id="h2"><span>==</span> what is our only hope in life and death?</h2>
<p>›</p>that we are not our own, but belong, body and soul, both in in life and death, to God and our saviour Jesus Christ

<p>›</p>“for me to live is Christ and to die is gain”

<h2 id="h4"><span>==</span> JT Job</h2>
<p>›</p>Jenkins:  the Spirit of God has fallen on our young people.  I am unable to do anything.  I am in the middle of the sound of the wind.  God himself is here.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It is Spring and I don’t know what to say – only weep and yet I cannot weep.  Twenty year old girls are prophesying.  It is early hours of the morning and I am unable to go to bed

<p>›</p>...  the place last night over-packed.  Old drunkards are coming in, and in the meeting they shout out for prayer and are praising God before they come out

<p>›</p>this letter was written to JTJob in North Wales

<p>›</p>This has been the darkest week of my life.  I have been forced into terrible depths.  I called on God, ‘Spare her’, but that was not His will.  I am like a vessel in the tempest at the mercy of the waves.  Etta is away and I had to bury sweet Non without her mother seeing her.” Was this cause for bitterness?  Listen to this next entry;  “Yet He must have a glorious reason for all of this, or else I must throw my Bible overboard.  But I would rather drown with the Bible in my hand than live without it

<p>›</p>JTJob:  i felt the Holy Spirit as a deluge of light causing my whole nature to quake.  I saw Jesus Christ and my nature turned to liquid at His feet ...  i am filled with some inexpressible joy ...  i feel i can pray by laughing these days

<p>›</p>Job describes the meeting as a ‘Hurricane of the Holy Spirit’
<p>›</p>After twenty minutes the whole place was awash with tears.  The chapel was as a field of wheat shaken by the wind.  One young man could not control himself any longer
<p>›</p>Job described the scene as a godly mayhem, and the meeting continued (530pm) until 1030pm

<p>›</p>placing our burdens at Jesus feet was what was preached – that God has done it all, it does not depend on my good works, or my sorting out my burdens;  i can simply come, and place them in His hands


<h2 id="h5"><span>==</span> one of the biggest challenges is coming to Christ with our suffering</h2>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> joel2.12-13 Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.” 13Rend your heart and not your garments.  Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity</tt>

<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> mourning turns us to God, there is a benefit to it</tt>

<p>›</p>heb10.25b Encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching

<p>›</p>[[% 2cor1.3-11 read together out loud
<p>›</p>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.  5For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.  6If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation;  if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.  7And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort

<p>›</p>8We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia.  We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself.  9Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death.  But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.  10He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again.  On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, 11as you help us by your prayers.  Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.]]


<tt class="action"><span>%</span> 1peter1.3-11 read together out loud</tt>
<p>›</p>It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Now we live with great expectation, 4and we have a priceless inheritance—an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.  5And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see

<p>›</p>6So be truly glad.  There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while.  7These trials will show that your faith is genuine.  It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere gold.  So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world

<p>›</p>8You love him even though you have never seen him.  Though you do not see him now, you trust him;  and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.  9The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls
