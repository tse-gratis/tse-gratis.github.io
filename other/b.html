<p>›</p>Jane Anne Denise Bethan Sean




  <p>›</p>the truth, for the sake of comparison
<p>›</p>reveals the Word, so place alongside the word of God

<p>›</p>the message is not readily lost to changes in word usage, technology, cultural context, or the passage of time.  Literal, detailed narratives are more susceptible to becoming archaic or obsolescent.  Two thousand years later, the imagery is still vivid.  We can still understand the concept of a growing seed.  Jesus’ parables are brilliant in their simplicity.  This storytelling approach also promotes practicing principles rather than inflexible adherence to laws


<p>›</p>a fool am i
<p>›</p>let me be at least a fool for Christ
<p>›</p>burdened by taking the glory
<p>›</p>a love and concern for these people


<p>›</p>LORD i dont have what it takes
<p>›</p>what would you like to do in this meeting
<p>›</p>invite you to come



<h1 id="h0"><span>=</span> verses</h1>
<p>›</p>Rev3.20
<p>›</p>Here I am!  I stand at the door and knock.  If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me

<p>›</p>John 14:23
<p>›</p>Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word.  My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him

<p>›</p>Matthew 7:7-8
<p>›</p>Ask, and it will be given to you;  seek, and you will find;  knock, and the door will be opened to you.  / For everyone who asks receives;  he who seeks finds;  and to him who knocks, the door will be opened



<h1 id="h1"><span>=</span> pre-intro</h1>
<p>›</p>the axe slammed ...  your prayers saved me that night

<p>›</p>that’s a short story intro, of someone i met in Uganda

<h1 id="h2"><span>=</span> intro</h1>
<p>›</p>mark4.33-34 Jesus used many stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand.  In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables;  but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them

<p>›</p>about 1/3 of Jesus teaching is in short story form, parables

<h1 id="h3"><span>=</span> parable meaning</h1>
<p>›</p>an earthly story with a heavenly meaning
<p>›</p>para balw
	<p>›</p>a heavenly reality “thrown alongside” an everyday situation

<p>›</p>ballw is one of the most common verbs in NT
  <p>›</p>throw out your nets
  <p>›</p>24 elders cast their crowns
  <p>›</p>If anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15).  βάλλω thereby marks the terminus of evil, the vindication of righteousness, and the beginning of unbroken fellowship with God

<h1 id="h4"><span>=</span> today’s parable</h1>
<p>›</p>Here I am!  I stand at the door and knock.  If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me

<h1 id="h5"><span>=</span> start by throwing the heavenly meaning alongside some normal situations</h1>
<p>›</p>youtube video https://youtube.com/shorts/R123Sofajnw?si=j1d8zj0DrBG-JIYr

<p>›</p>my wife hearing from God



<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> pray to start;  Father, we open our door to you, and we ask to hear your voice, and invite you in</tt>

<p>›</p>[[% if they’ve got stories ...]]

<h1 id="h6"><span>=</span> read verses</h1>
<p>›</p>john14.23 matt7.7-8 then rev3.20

<p>›</p>[[john10
<p>›</p>.9 I am the door:  by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture
<p>›</p>.10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.  I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.]]

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> how do we understand this?</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what is Jesus aiming for in this parable?</tt>
<tt class="action"><span>%</span> where is Jesus knocking in our own lives?</tt>

<p>›</p>to the lukewarm church in Laodicea,
<p>›</p>seeking admittance to a church!  It’s alarming to think of Jesus standing outside of the church



<h1 id="h7"><span>=</span> question</h1>
<p>›</p>Q:
<p>›</p>how can we shine brightly for Jesus?  (Phil 2:15)
  <p>›</p>you will shine like stars in the heavens
  <p>›</p>you will bear much fruit if you remain in me

<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what specific steps can we do towards this</tt>
	<p>›</p>(in general is easy, listen to Jesus, be obedient, but specifically......)

<p>›</p>phil2.15
<p>›</p>so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world

<p>›</p>Daniel 12:3
<p>›</p>Then the wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever
