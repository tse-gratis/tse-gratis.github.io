<p>›</p>There is less drinking, less idleness, less gambling.  Men record with almost incredulous amazement, how one football player after another has foresworn cards and drink and the gladiatorial games, and is living a sober and godly life, putting his energy into the revival

<p>›</p>Listen to these two confessions at Ammanford.  The first is from a middle-aged man holding a baby in his arms:  “I used to spend three or four pounds in a single evening at the bar.  I’d give my wife and children a few stray shillings now and then.  I’d steal coppers from my child’s money-box and spend them for beer.  I was seldom sober.  But, thank God, that’s done with

	<p>›</p>this is the hope of the world

<p>›</p>the revival meetings had a great openness to the Spirit

	<p>›</p>that you are the light of the world, and these gifts of God are placed in your hands



<p>›</p>In connection with the Welsh revival there is no preaching, no order, no hymnbooks, no choirs, no organs, no collections, and, finally, no advertising

<p>›</p>There are two essential functions to the Christian priesthood:  The first is eucharistic, the giving of thanks;  the other is intercessory, praying.  That is all.  That is going on.  The Church everywhere singing and praying and offering praise, and pleading with God.  Every meeting is made up almost exclusively of these things

<h2 id="h1"><span>==</span> Evan’s report</h2>
<p>›</p>What was the revival?  It was the love of God that swept them away.  Evan Roberts writes:  ‘I felt a wave of love for my fellow-men flowing into my soul’

<p>›</p>Their song was “Here is love is love vast as the ocean”

<h2 id="h2"><span>==</span> quoted report</h2>
<p>›</p>I say to you today, beloved, without any hesitation, that this whole thing is of God, that it is a visitation in which He is making men conscious of Himself, without any human agency

<h2 id="h3"><span>==</span> G.  Campbell Morgan’s report</h2>
<p>›</p>“No books, but, oh my, I nearly wept tonight over the singing of our last hymn.  . . . When these Welshmen sing, they sing the words like men who believe them.  They abandon themselves to their singing.  We sing as though we thought it would not be respectable to be heard by the man next to us.  No choir, did I say?  It was all choir!  And hymns!  I stood and listened in wonder and amazement as that congregation on that night sang hymn after hymn, long hymns, sung through without hymn-books”

<p>›</p>This was not a revival of preaching;  it was a revival of praising God;  of being swept up in His presence, in His love song

<h2 id="h4"><span>==</span> pastor’s report</h2>
<p>›</p>“I have no more doubt of its being a work of God than I have of my own existence.  As to describing the revival and estimating its results, can you put in words those deep and hallowed experiences of life realized when God meets you almost palpably and sways your whole being cross-ward, heavenward, and the atmosphere trembles with light, life, love, joy, praise, reverence, awe” (Shaw, 92)

<p>›</p>“No wonder the people could not sleep and could not stay away from the meetings.  No wonder the services carried on till two and three o’clock in the morning and then resulted in a march through the streets with the people singing the praises of The Lamb!

<h2 id="h5"><span>==</span> newspaper’s report</h2>
<p>›</p>“The scene was almost indescribable.  Tier upon tier of men and women filled every inch of space.  Those who could not gain admittance stood outside and listened at the doors.  Others rushed to the windows, where almost every word was audible.  When, at seven o’clock, the service began, quite 2,000 people must have been present.  The enthusiasm was unbounded.  Women sang and shouted till the perspiration ran down their faces, and men jumped up one after the other to testify.  One told in quivering accents the story of a drunken life.  A working [man] spoke like a practiced orator:  and one can imagine what a note the testimony of a converted gypsy woman struck when, dressed in her best, she told of her reformation and repentance.  At ten o’clock the meeting had lost none of its ardor.  Prayer after prayer went up.  Time and again the four ministers who stood in the pulpit attempted to start a hymn, but it was all in vain.  The revival had taken hold of the people, and even Evan Roberts cannot hold it in check.  His latest convert is a policeman, who, after complaining that people had gone mad after religion, so that there was nothing to do, went to see for himself, and bursting into tears, confessed the error of his ways, and repented”

<p>›</p>During one meeting a well-known skeptic in the town interrupted Evan Roberts as he preached.  “I want to ask a question,” he shouted.  Evan ignored him.  “I want to ask a question,” he yelled angrily again.  “If you do not answer me, I will come to pulpit to ask my question.” Everyone ignored him, so he began to make his way to the pulpit to confront Evan Roberts.  An eyewitness to the event described what happened next:

<p>›</p>“As in the case of Saul of Tarsus, on the Damascus Road, the Holy Spirit overpowered this man – he would have collapsed on the stairs had not the people upheld him – constraining him to cry out for mercy and pardon.  What a scene followed!  When the people realized the full import of what had happened, the shout went up, ‘He has been saved!  He has been saved!”

<h2 id="h6"><span>==</span> eyewitness report</h2>
<p>›</p>The most extraordinary thing about the meetings which I attended was the extent to which they were absolutely without any human direction or leadership.  “We must obey the Spirit,” is the watchword of Evan Roberts, and he is as obedient as the humblest of his followers.  The meetings open—after any amount of preliminary singing while the congregation is assembling—by the reading of a chapter or a psalm.  Then it is go as you please for two hours or more.   And the amazing thing is that it does go and does not get entangled in what might seem to be inevitable confusion.  Three-fourths of the meeting consists of singing.  No one uses a hymnbook.  No one gives out a hymn.  The last person to control the meeting in any way is Mr.  Evan Roberts.  People pray and sing, give testimony or exhort as the Spirit moves them.  As a study of the psychology of crowds I have seen nothing like it.  You feel that the thousand or fifteen hundred persons before you have become merged into one myriad-headed, but single-souled personality.   You can watch what they call the influence of the power of the Spirit playing over the crowded congregation as an eddying wind plays over the surface of a pond.  If anyone carried away by his feelings prays too long, or if anyone when speaking fails to touch the right note, someone—it may be anybody—commences to sing.  For a moment there is a hesitation as if the meeting were in doubt as to its decision, whether to hear the speaker or to continue to join in the prayer, or whether to sing.  If it decides to hear and to pray the singing dies away.  If, on the other hand, as usually happens, the people decide to sing, the chorus swells in volume until it drowns all other sound

<p>›</p>people with a passion and depth of close relationship



<p>›</p>He was a man confounded by his own sin.  He described himself as a most unfit and terrible sinner;  not ready for Judgement Day

<p>›</p>This changes for him on the 18th of June 1735
	<p>›</p>he writes:  ‘in prayer i felt a strong impression on my mind to give myself to God as i was, and to leave all to follow him’

	<p>›</p>it is as though Christ came for sinners, and so we trust not ourselves, but Him with our sin;  unready and unprepared we come, and dare to let the healer touch our wounds
	<p>›</p>Howell opened up the hidden parts of his heart to God.  are we ready to do that?  will i let the healer in, to be LORD of my broken places?

	<tt class="meta"><span>--</span> will we give ourselves to God as we are, and leave all to follow him?</tt>

	<p>›</p>Howell writes:  i felt my heart melting within me like wax before the fire with love to God my saviour, and felt not only love, peace ...  also a cry within my inmost soul which i was totaly unaquainted with before:  Abba, Father!  Abba Father!  i could not help calling God my Father;  i knew that i was his child, and that He loved me and heard me

	<p>›</p>“One day in prayer I felt a strong impression on my mind to give myself to God as I was, and to leave all to follow Him
	<p>›</p>...  I felt suddenly my heart melting within me like wax before the fire with love to God my Saviour;  and also felt not only love, peace etc, but longing to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.  Then was a cry in my inmost soul, which I was totally unacquainted with before, Abba, Father!  Abba, Father!  I could not help calling God my Father;  I knew that I was His child;  and that He loved me and heard me”

<p>›</p>Moriah started through Howell Harris visiting, 26yrs old and unordained, just as Evan Roberts was.  For Howell though in 1739 it was illegal for the unordained to preach.  The crowds could gather not to hear Howell but to beat him, and between blows, he would share the gospel

<p>›</p>Only 4 years earlier, 18th June 1735, Howells would describe himself as a most unfit and terrible sinner

<p>›</p>Howell Harris became a friend of John and Charles Wesley, and had his own near drowning experience here in the Lughour river;  as before there was a bridge (that you came across in the train), people would cross the river at low tide

<p>›</p>Howell helped make peace between the Wesley’s and George Whitfield, and led George Whitfield’s churches when George was away.  Howell is the founder of this church, aswell as many others, that formed the Calvinistic Methodists

<h2 id="h12"><span>==</span> that dispute, and George Whitfield</h2>
<p>›</p>Originally he led the Holy Club, but preached against the Wesleys
	<p>›</p>Calvinism v.s.  Arminianism

<p>›</p>Whitfield said to him, “Why dispute?  I am willing to go with you to prison, and to death, but I am not willing to oppose you.” Whitfield, though, was outraged when Wesley wrote an anti-predestination pamphlet and sent it to America

<p>›</p>Even though they never came to terms over their theological differences, in later life, they learned to respect each other.  One of Whitfield’s followers (who obviously still held great animosity against Wesley) said to Whitfield, “We won’t see John Wesley in the heaven, will we?” Whitfield humbly replied “Yes, you’re right, we won’t see him in heaven.  He will be so close to the Throne of God and we will be so far away, that we won’t be able to see him!”

<p>›</p>And at George’s request when George passed away, John preached at his memorial

<p>›</p>–
<p>›</p>let us be able to say that of all we disagree, and argue with ‘we wont see them in heaven.  They will be so close to the Throne of God, and we so far away, that we wont be able to see them’

<p>›</p>it was at unity of the Moravians that revival came
	<p>›</p>John17.21&23 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.  May they also be in us, so that the world may believe ...  I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity.  Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me

<h1 id="h14"><span>=</span> who was Howell Harris?</h1>
<p>›</p>He was a man confounded by his own sin.  He described himself as a most unfit and terrible sinner;  not ready for Judgement Day

<p>›</p>changes for him 1735june18:
<p>›</p>‘in prayer i felt a strong impression on my mind to give myself to God as i was, and to leave all to follow him’

<p>›</p>will we give ourselves to God as we are, and leave all to follow him?



<h1 id="h15"><span>=</span> Joseph Jenkins</h1>
<p>›</p>Joseph Jenkins was in desperation as a pastor, seeing his own spritual need, and spends nights in prayer.  one night he is on his knees praying, and loosing all sense of time he decides to lay hold of God until he is clothed with power
	<p>›</p>He had an intense spiritual encounter
	<p>›</p>From this, he was not content to speak about God;  but to encounter HIM, and so he asks his congregation not to sit and listen, but to encounter;  to come alive, to respond
		<p>›</p>He asks them “What does Jesus mean to you?”
		<tt class="action"><span>%</span> what does Jesus mean to you?</tt>

	<p>›</p>Florrie stands and says
		<p>›</p>‘I think I love the LORD Jesus with all my heart’
	<p>›</p>this breakthrough in her own heart, changed the meeting.  a journalist at that meeting wrote “The pathos and the passion of that avowal acted like an electric shock upon the congregation.  One after another they rose and made the full surrender...”

<p>›</p>Florrie Evans – I love the LORD with all my heart
	<p>›</p>A gentle weeping spread throughout the congregation
	<p>›</p>And from their to the surrounding chapels

<p>›</p>Florrie Evans
  <p>›</p>Joseph Jenkins – letters, meetings discussing their spiritual state and realizing their spiritual need.  led to a desperation, and nights spent in prayer 1903-1904 One night he was on his knees praying and, having lost all sense of time, he decided to lay hold of God until he was clothed with power from on high.  It was on this night he experienced a blue flame which surrounded him, which was part of his intense spiritual experience

<p>›</p>He was asking not just to write about God, or speak about him;  but to encounter HIM

<p>›</p>He calls for this encounter for his congregation, and one young girl struggles.  He asks her if she can say ‘my Lord’, to the Lord Jesus
  <tt class="action"><span>%</span> can you say my Lord to the Lord Jesus?</tt>

<p>›</p>Convinced by the Spirit of truth, Florrie soon yielded to her Lord’s demand to reign on the throne of her heart.  Obedience to the promptings of the Spirit now would be her aim, and soon the shy girl would follow through in significant fashion

<p>›</p>In Feb, asks Congregation “What does Jesus mean to you?”  Wasn’t rehtorical, it was a request for them to come alive;  to respond
  <tt class="action"><span>%</span> What does Jesus mean to you?</tt>
<p>›</p>Florrie stands and says “If no one else will, then I must say that I love the Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart”

<p>›</p>read letters p44 p46

<p>›</p>this request to join in;  to step from listening to the gospel, to living it was a major part of the revival

<p>›</p>these were people who had found their Spiritual need, and were hungry for God
	<p>›</p>and God began to answer that hunger
	<p>›</p>john3.34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit


<p>›</p>This is the environment that Evan Roberts walks into, he was asking the Spirit should he pray.  he writes:
<p>›</p>My bosom boiled all through, and had it not been that I prayed, I would have burst.  What boiled in my bosom?  The verse, “for God commendeth His love.” I fell on my knees, with my arms outstretched on the seat before me, the perspiration poured down my face and my tears streamed quickly until I thought that the blood came out

<h2 id="h16"><span>==</span> letter 1904march28</h2>
<p>›</p>the Spirit of God has fallen on our young people.  I am unable to do anything.  I am in the middle of the sound of the wind.  God himself is here.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It is Spring and I don’t know what to say – only weep and yet I cannot weep.  Twenty year old girls are prophesying.  It is early hours of the morning and I am unable to go to bed.  I must try to pray.  I know that you will be pleased to hear this news.  I do not know where to start with anything.  I organised a meeting for the youth before and ...  the tide now is truly powerful

<h2 id="h17"><span>==</span> letter 1904may5</h2>
<p>›</p>I have been thinking for days and weeks of writing you a letter (to break this quietness), to give you the history of the revival here amidst the young people more specifically.  Yet the gentle atmosphere is also on the midde aged and the old.  They are being called `Christian Endeavour Meetings`.  In the end many of these meetings break out in praise to God ...  Some praying, while others halfway through the prayers break out to sing, young girls mainly, girls in service to go forward to pray without being asked

<p>›</p>There is a meeting after the morning service in the vestry.  All these meetings are being held in the vestry with the preachers going into them and some of the preachers experiencing emotions they have never felt before.  The eyes of all are filled with tears when the girls pray.  [[I will name some of them:  Florrie Evans is about 20 years of age...]]

<p>›</p>They come here three or four miles distance from the county.  The place last night over-packed.  (Old drunkards are coming in, and in the meeting they shout out for prayer and are praising God before they come out).  [[Yes this is how it is now.  I hope this is how it will continue.  It is easy to pray and preach here...]]


<p>›</p>This is the environment that Evan Roberts walks into, he was asking the Spirit should he pray.  he writes:
<p>›</p>My bosom boiled all through, and had it not been that I prayed, I would have burst.  What boiled in my bosom?

<p>›</p>Charles stepped outside to speak with them
	<p>›</p>and someone threw a rock that struck him in the face
<p>›</p>Charles began to preach, and as he did so an army officer drew his sword and charged at him with the intention of thrusting his sword through Charles Wesley’s heart

<h1 id="h23"><span>=</span> Evan Roberts</h1>
<h2 id="h24"><span>==</span> quotes</h2>
<p>›</p>Why should I teach when the Spirit is teaching?  What need have these people to be told that they are sinners?  What they need is salvation.  Do they not know it?  It is not knowledge that they lack, but decision – action.  And why should I control the meetings?  The meetings control themselves, or rather the Spirit that is in them controls them

<p>›</p>But one night, after I had been in great distress praying about this, I went to sleep, and at one o’clock in the morning suddenly I was waked up out of my sleep, and I found myself with unspeakable joy and awe in the very presence of the Almighty God.  And for the space of four hours I was privileged to speak face to face with Him as a man speaks face to face with a friend.  At five o’clock it seemed to me as if I again returned to earth

<p>›</p>The people are the meeting, not the preacher, once his short talk is ended, though his spirit remains to fire them to congregational rather than individual leadership
<p>›</p>None of the hundreds of dramatic scenes that have occurred in these meetings have come while Roberts has been talking.  They have come afterwards and often a considerable time afterwards
<p>›</p>If it has been by the foolishness of preaching that men have been saved heretofore, that agency seems as if it were destined to take a back seat in the present movement

<p>›</p>“I beseech all those who confess Christ to ask Him today, upon their knees, if He has not some work for them to do now.  He will lead them as He has led us.  He will make them pillars of smoke by day and pillars of fire by night to guide all men to Him.  Wonderful things have happened in Wales in only a few weeks, but they are only the beginning.  The world will be swept by His Spirit as by a rushing mighty wind
<p>›</p>Many who are now silent Christians, negative Christians, Christians whose belief means little to them and nothing to anyone else, will lead in the movement
<p>›</p>...  This is my earnest faith, if the churches will learn the great lesson of obedience to the voice of the Holy Spirit.  Obedience!  Obedience!  Obedience!”


<p>›</p>Evan ‘I am happy and more than happy.  I possess some unspeakable joy – night and day.  We have a happy and joyful God.  Now when we speak of religion we are full of joy, and our faces light up with joy.  Shake off this death-like solemnity and be joyful ever joyful’

<p>›</p>newspaper interview
<p>›</p>‘you are doing very good work!’
<p>›</p>‘don’t say that.  i am nothing.  it is not my work.  it is the work of God, and i am glad to be a humble instrument in his hands’
<p>›</p>‘is it your intention to continue in mission work?’
<p>›</p>‘i cannot tell you.  i am in the hands of God, and he will direct me what to do and where to go’
<p>›</p>‘i am afraid you are over-taxing your strength’
<p>›</p>‘no, no i am not.  the Holy Spirit will sustain me...  i have been praying for the Holy Spirit for 13 years.  Oh!  it is glorious.  what i want is for the people to know the joy of religion.  it should be the happiest thing in life.  ...  the world is vainly trying to find joy in pleasure.  It will only find real pleasure in life is in following our Lord and Master’

<p>›</p>is it that revival is always here for us?
<p>›</p>just as God’s love is always here for us – but we did not know it?
<p>›</p>Gen28.16-17 When Jacob woke from his slumber, he said, “Surely the IAM is in this place, and I was unaware of it.” 17Then he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place!  This is none other than the house of God;  this is the gate of heaven!”
<p>›</p>will we not open our eyes?  will we want the fire?
	<p>›</p>‘Is it possible that God is offering the Spirit and we are unprepared to receive Him?’
	<p>›</p>this was Evan’s question, and as he said ‘I have only to want the fire.  I have built the altar, laid the wood and prepared the offering;  I have only to want for the fire’

<p>›</p>Bend the Church, and save the world,” is the watchword of this revival

<p>›</p>too much singing moves only surface emotions and takes the congregations’ mind from the deeper influence of prayer and close communion with God.  He believes completely in the efficacy of prayer, and he has for many years spent a considerable amount of time daily upon his knees

<p>›</p>Evan Roberts speaks:  “Let us see what God’s Spirit will do for us in a quiet meeting.  It did wonderful things at Lougher when no one sung or spoke.” A few moments later all are kneeling in five minutes of silent prayer.  The crowded room is still except for quick gasps of sobbing breath from those who are deeply moved.  Here and there a half audible voice is mumbling inarticulate prayer.  Deeper yet grows time silence and more impressive.  Wrinkled faces are upturned, and unseeing eyes look upward.  Heads are bowed in folded hands.  Shoulders are convulsed with emotion, and lips are moving from which no sound comes.  Still the preacher gives no sign.  Gradually a single low voice is heard in all parts of the chapel, singing sweetly the hymn, “Have you seen Him?” in Welsh.  For an instant there is time stillness of listening with bated breath;  then slowly other voices join in singing until the building rings with thrilling melody.  It is as if they have burst from prayer into song

<p>›</p>For a long, long time I was much troubled in my soul and my heart by thinking over the failure of Christianity.  Oh!  it seemed such a failure—such a failure—and I prayed and prayed, but nothing seemed to give me any relief.  But one night, after I had been in great distress praying about this, I went to sleep, and at one o’clock in the morning suddenly I was waked up out of my sleep, and I found myself with unspeakable joy and awe in the very presence of the Almighty God.

<p>›</p>“No, I was wide awake.  And it was not only that morning, but every morning for three or four months.  Always I enjoyed four hours of that wonderful communion with God.  I cannot describe it.  I felt it, and it seemed to change all my nature

			<p>›</p>“I saw at once that we had taken the whole thing into our hands.  ‘Shall we go?’  should be the first question”
	<p>›</p>“Oh that we would all feel that we can nothing without the Holy Spirit, and in that feeling fall in lowliness before God with a broken heart, beseeching Him to show us His face, ..., it would be awful for us to be without God”

<p>›</p>this is the plan, we begin by:

<h3 id="h36"><span>===</span> prayer circle, also the seiat & discipleship</h3>
<p>›</p>every person present praying ‘Send the Holy Spirit now for Jesus sake’ ‘Anfon yr Ysbryd yn awr, er mwyn Iesu Grist, Amen’

<p>›</p>dancing in the seats.  One of our deacons was filled, he came to me and embraced me and kissed me, while many in the congregation stood on their feet and on the benches, and Oh!  What joy!  He was clapping his hands and saying ‘Diolch iddo’ ‘Thanks be to him’ and laughing.  You could think that he was mad – for he was mad with joy.  From 10 to 20 were filled last night

<p>›</p>‘I know not what to write.  I am almost too full.  My heart is full and brimming over with joy.  The Holy Spirit descended in power at Moriah tonight – or rather Monday morning – between midnight and 1am
 <p>›</p>The result of last weel’s work are almost incredible.  Peace has been made between many

<p>›</p>other times finishing past 4am.  as in life, that obedience to the Spirit showed in His meetings;  his desire was not to lead, but to see each person and moment led by the Spirit
	<p>›</p>this openness to the Spirit was also an invite to others to share


<p>›</p>What was the revival?  It was the love of God that swept them away.  Evan Roberts writes:  ‘I felt a wave of love for my fellow-men flowing into my soul’

<p>›</p>Their song was “Here is love is love vast as the ocean”



<h1 id="h37"><span>=</span> post revival</h1>
<p>›</p>Evan become an intercessor
	<p>›</p>he became convinced that the work of intercession was vital.  He gave himself to prayer and believed that he reached more this way
