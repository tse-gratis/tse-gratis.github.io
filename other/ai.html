i did street preaching for first time today. i notice the church in Acts started from the apostles street preaching

after that preaching we get the first description of the church, and as we're at the beginning of meeting together, i thought it would be good to take a look at three of those verses

% they read
% what did they see in those verses?

</td><td style="background-color:#ddd"><b>Suggestions:</b>
Specify the verses: For your actual study. A key passage is Acts 2:42â€“47
Expand the "what did they see" question. To guide your group toward deeper insights, consider observation questions:
	"Who? Who was involved in this new community? What was their background?"
	"What? What specific activities or practices did they engage in? What was the outcome?"
	"How? How did they relate to one another and the outside world? What was their attitude?"
Add an interpretation phase: ask what these observations mean for understanding the early church
	"Based on your observations, what does this passage reveal about the nature of the early church?"
